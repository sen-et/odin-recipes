    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is the closest you can get (for now) to a vegan cinnabon. While it's an extremely delicious recipe, it is not healthy at all, though it's very comforting. Will take at least 2-3 hours to complete.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegan butter</li>
        <li>2 cups room temperature almond milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegan butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup organic sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet active dry yeast</li>
        <li>5 1/2 cups flour, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup vegan butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons almond milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Generously rub two disposable foil pie pans with vegan butter.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted butter, and sugar. The mixture should be just warm, registering between 100-110˚F (37-43˚C). If it is hotter, allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the warm mixture and let set for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add 5 cups flour and 1 teaspoon of salt to the milk mixture and mix with a wooden spoon until just combined.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with a towel or plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350˚F (180˚C).</li>
        <li>After 1 hour, the dough should have nearly doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Remove the towel and add an additional ½ cup (95g) of flour and salt. Stir well, then turn out onto a well-floured surface.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough lightly, adding additional flour as necessary, until the dough just loses its stickiness and does not stick to the surface.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about ½-inch (1 cm) thick. Fix corners to make sure they are sharp and even.</li>
        <li>Spread the softened vegan butter evenly over the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle evenly with brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Roll up the dough, forming a log, and pinch the seam closed. Place seam-side down. Trim off any unevenness on either end.</li>
        <li>Cut the log in half, then divide each half into 7 evenly sized pieces. About 1½ inches (8 cm) thick each.</li>
        <li>Place 7 cinnamon rolls in each cake pan, one in the center, six around the sides. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>To prepare the frosting. In a medium-size mixing bowl, whisk together powdered sugar, almond milk, and vanilla until smooth.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic wrap. Bake the cinnamon rolls in a preheated oven at 350˚F (180˚C) for 25-30 minutes, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>While still warm, drizzle evenly with frosting.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
